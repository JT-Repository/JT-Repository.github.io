This track, and the subsequent video, attempts to encapsulate the constant despondency, rejection, disillusionment, alienation and the perpetual worry that comes with being long term unemployed, while at the same time it’s creation provided some element of personal catharsis along the way.",

        "description": "A techno jam recorded live one afternoon in June 2016. The Roland TR-8 is obviously providing the drums, while the Elektron Analog Four supplies the bass, lead, drone and the rasping stab that comes in for the final third part. The Korg Volca Sample provides the one shots and vocal samples that are triggered manually. There’s an excellent trick to get more sample time, for less memory, out of the Volca Sample. Pitch the original samples up 12, 24 or 36 semitones in an audio editor before exporting and then restore back to the original pitch in the Volca by using the Speed knob. The RE-20 Space Echo is used extensively and there’s a touch of TC Electronic’s Hall Of Fame Reverb over most channels.",
