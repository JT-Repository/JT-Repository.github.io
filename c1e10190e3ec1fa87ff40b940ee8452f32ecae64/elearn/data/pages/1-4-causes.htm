<h1>Causes</h1>
<p>A learning disability happens when a person's brain development is affected, either before they are born, during their birth or in early childhood.</p>
<p>Learning disabilities can be caused by any one of a variety of factors, or by a combination. Sometimes the specific cause is not known. Possible causes include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An inherited condition, meaning that certain genes passed from the parents affected the brain development, for example Fragile X.</li>
	<li>Chromosome abnormalities such as Down's syndrome or Turner syndrome</li>
	<li>Complications during birth resulting in a lack of oxygen to the brain</li>
	<li>A very premature birth</li>
	<li>Mother's illness during pregnancy</li>
	<li>The mother drinking during pregnancy, for example Foetal Alcohol Syndrome</li>
	<li>A debilitating illness or injury in early childhood affecting brain development, for example a road traffic accident or child abuse</li>
	<li>Contact with damaging material (like radiation)</li>
	<li>Neglect, and/or a lack of mental stimulation early in life</li>
	<li>Some people with learning disabilities have additional physical disabilities and/or sensory impairments</li>
	<li>the mother becoming ill in pregnancy</li>
	<li>problems during the birth that stop enough oxygen getting to the brain</li>
	<li>the unborn baby developing certain genes</li>
	<li>the parents passing certain genes to the unborn baby that make having a learning disability more likely  (known as inherited learning disability)</li> 
	<li>illness, such as meningitis, or injury in early childhood</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes there is no known cause for a learning disability.</p>
<p>Some conditions are associated with having a learning disability, such as cerebral palsy. This is because people with these conditions are more likely to have one. </p>
<p>Everyone with Down's syndrome, for example, has a form of learning disability, and so do many people with cerebral palsy. People with autism may also have learning disabilities, and around 30% of people with epilepsy have a learning disability.</p>
