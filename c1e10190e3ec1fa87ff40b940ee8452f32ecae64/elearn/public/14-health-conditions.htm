<h1>Associated health conditions</h1>
<p>Common associated health conditions for people with a learning disability include mental health problems, epilepsy, and being underweight or overweight.</p>
<h2>Mental health</h2> 
<p>In 2017/18 severe mental illness was 8.4 times more common in patients with a learning disability than those without.</p>
<p>In 2017/18, 13.3% of patients with a learning disability had an active diagnosis of depression, compared to 12.2% in 2014/15 (NHS Digital, 2019).</p>
<h2>Epilepsy</h2>
<p>Research suggests that epilepsy is more common in adults with a learning disability than those without a learning disability; and is more common amongst men and those with a higher level of impairment (McGrother et al. 2006; Epilepsy Society, 2019 ; Robertson et al., 2015).</p>
<p>Estimates vary but in a review of 38 studies, the pooled estimate of prevalence of epilepsy in people with a learning disability was 22% (Robertson et al., 2015).</p>
<h2>Being underweight or overweight</h2>
<p>The proportion of people with a learning disability receiving body mass index (BMI) checks has increased from 58.3% in 2016/17 to 61.5% in 2017/18.</p>
<p>Of those receiving BMI checks, 6.4% of patients with a recorded learning disability were classified as underweight (BMI â‰¤18.4), this was higher than for those with no recorded learning disability (4.9%).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 37.5% of people with a learning disability were classified as obese, this was also greater than those without a learning disability (29.9%) (NHS Digital, 2019).</p>
<h2>Dementia</h2>
<p>The rate of dementia is high in all people with a learning disability, but is particularly high in people with Down's syndrome.</p>
<p>In 2017/18, the prevalence rate for people with a learning disability aged 55-64 was 4.3%, compared to 0.3% of those with no learning disability.</p>
<p>For ages 65-74 it was 5.9% for people with a learning disability, compared to 1.1% for those without.</p>
<p>For those aged 75 and over it was 11.2% for people with a learning disability, compared to 8.7% for those without.</p>
