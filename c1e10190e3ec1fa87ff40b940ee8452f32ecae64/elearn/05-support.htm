<h1>Support</h1>
<p>People with learning disabilities do not learn certain skills as quickly as other people and may therefore need extra help in certain aspects of their lives. The specific skills in question will depend upon the type of disability. People with mild learning disabilities may live alone, travel independently, and work. People with learning difficulties have the same right to access healthcare as all other people. However, due to a number of factors, patients with learning disabilities find it far harder to access healthcare and therefore suffer the consequences, including earlier death and poor long-term condition management, as identified by Sir Jonathan Michael in his public inquiry into accessing healthcare for those with learning difficulties. As a health professional, you should actively promote the rights of those with learning difficulties and help them to overcome the issues they face in accessing healthcare. Depending on the situation, this may take many forms, but could include:</p> 
<ul>
    <li>supporting them in phoning the GP surgery to make an appointment</li>
    <li>arranging for a friend or relative to escort them to a hospital visit</li>
    <li>helping them to plan their journey to visit their local GP surgery</li>
</ul>
<p>They may not require any support from their local authority, or may just need support in managing their finances. Other people may require more regular support to ensure their safety and health on a daily basis. Those with more severe or complex needs may need extensive, hour-to-hour help in performing basic skills, such as eating, dressing and washing.</p>
<p>With the right support people can live full and meaningful lives. However, if this support is not provided they may face problems in gaining independence or a home of their own, in accessing leisure and recreation activities, and/or in developing friendships and relationships.</p>
