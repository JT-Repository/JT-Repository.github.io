<h1>Barriers to support</h1>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>Adults with learning disabilities may find it difficult to communicate their needs and wishes. This does not mean that they do not have a preference. It should not be assumed that people with learning disabilities cannot make decisions for themselves. Access to advocate services can support individuals to do this more confidently.</p>
<p>People who are living with learning disabilities may benefit from face-to-face support, rather than over the phone or email. Face-to-face communication is less likely to be misinterpreted by a service provider or a service user.</p>
<h2>Mental Health Difficulties</h2>
<p>People with learning disabilities are more likely to experience mental health conditions or disorders. Poor mental health can make someone more vulnerable to domestic abuse and also less likely to leave someone who is causing them harm.</p>
<h2>Social Attitudes</h2>
<p>Learning difficulties are often "invisible" so people are less likely to recognise that someone needs additional help or support. Adults with learning difficulties are less likely to receive education around safe sex and healthy relationships, which leaves them more vulnerable to spotting the signs of domestic abuse.</p>
<h2>Inequalities in Health for Learning Disabilities</h2>
<p>People with a learning disability have worse physical and mental health than people without a learning disability.</p>
<p>On average, the life expectancy of women with a learning disability is 18 years shorter than for women in the general population. The life expectancy of men with a learning disability is 14 years shorter than for men in the general population.</p>
