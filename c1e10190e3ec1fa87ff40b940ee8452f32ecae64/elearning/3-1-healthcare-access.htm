<h1>Access to healthcare</h1>
<p>A number of barriers are stopping people with a learning disability from getting good quality healthcare.</p>
<p>These barriers include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a lack of accessible transport links</li>
    <li>patients not being identified as having a learning disability</li>
    <li>staff having little understanding about learning disability</li>
    <li>failure to recognise that a person with a learning disability is unwell</li>
    <li>failure to make a correct diagnosis</li>
    <li>anxiety or a lack of confidence for people with a learning disability</li>
    <li>lack of joint working from different care providers</li>
    <li>not enough involvement allowed from carers</li>
    <li>inadequate aftercare or follow-up care</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inequalities in Health for Learning Disabilities</h2>
<p>People with a learning disability have worse physical and mental health than people without a learning disability.</p>
<p>On average, the life expectancy of women with a learning disability is 18 years shorter than for women in the general population. The life expectancy of men with a learning disability is 14 years shorter than for men in the general population.</p>
<h2>Poor quality healthcare causes avoidable deaths</h2>
<p>The Confidential Inquiry into premature deaths of people with a learning disability also found that 38% of people with a learning disability died from an avoidable cause, compared to 9% in a comparison population of people without a learning disability.</p>
<p>The LeDeR found that out of 112 deaths reviewed in a multi-agency review panel, only 19% had been potentially avoidable.</p>
