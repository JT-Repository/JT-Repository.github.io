<h1>Legislation</h1>
<p>People with learning difficulties have the same rights as all other people; these rights are detailed within the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>
<p>According to the Equality Act 2010, a person is disabled if a physical or mental impairment has a substantial and long-term negative effect on their ability to carry out normal daily activities. This definition will apply to nearly all of those suffering from a learning disability. The Equality Act extends certain rights to those recognised as suffering from a disability including:</p>
<h2>Employment rights</h2>
<p>It is against the law for employers to discriminate against a person because of a disability. All employers must make reasonable adjustments so those with disabilities are not disadvantaged. 
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>It is unlawful for education providers to treat disabled students unfavourably. This may be due to direct or indirect discrimination or forms of harassment or victimisation. As with employers, education providers must make reasonable adjustments to ensure that disabled students are not discriminated against.</p>
<h2>Police</h2>

        <p>A person with a learning disability should only be interviewed when a responsible person is present. The responsible person, or 'appropriate adult', should not work for the police and should have experience of working with people with learning difficulties. The only exception to this is when a delay would result in harm to people, property or evidence. Consent and capacity Adults with a learning disability have the same legal rights and freedoms as anyone else.</p>
        <p>Having a learning difficulty does not automatically mean a person lacks mental capacity; in fact, the majority will have full capacity. As always, you must assess your patient as the individual they are and have no pre-conceived ideas as to their potential mental ability until you have completed a formal.</p>
