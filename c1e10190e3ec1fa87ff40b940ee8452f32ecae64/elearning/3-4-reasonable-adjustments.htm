<h1>Reasonable adjustments</h1>
<p>A lack of reasonable adjustments can be a barrier to accessing healthcare settings and to equal healthcare.</p>
<p>The Confidential Inquiry into premature deaths of people with learning disabilities (CIPOLD) reviews showed the lack of reasonable adjustments provided to people with a learning disability (especially in accessing clinic appointments and investigations) as a contributory factor in a number of avoidable deaths.</p>
<p>Healthcare professionals have a legal duty to provide reasonable adjustments for disabled people (Public Health England, 2016). This can include providing easy-read information, avoiding medical jargon or longer appointment times.</p>
