        <p>In general, a learning disability constitutes a condition which affects learning and intelligence across all areas of life, whereas a learning difficulty constitutes a condition which creates an obstacle to a specific form of learning, but does not affect the overall IQ of an individual.</p>
        <p>For example, Down's syndrome is classed as a learning disability, whereas dyslexia is classed as a learning difficulty, in that it only affects an individual's relationship to the processing of information, usually manifested in problems with reading, writing, and spelling.</p>
        <p>A learning disability is a permanent condition developing at the latest in early childhood, whereas mental illness (or a mental health problem) can develop at any time, and is not necessarily permanent. People can get better and resolve mental health problems with help and treatment.</p>
